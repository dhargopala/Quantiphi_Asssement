Creating VPC, public subnets:

Login to AWS management console and navigate to the VPC console. Select “Your VPCs” from sidebar and click on “Create VPC”
Enter VPC CIDR details as belowName tag: MyVPC
IPv4 CIDR block* : 10.0.0.0/16

Make sure to select “MyVPC”  under “VPC”  drop down menu and enter 10.0.1.0/24 in “IPv4 CIDR block” for public subnet.

Now create Private subnet with CIDR 10.0.2.0/24

Create and Attach “Internet Gateway” to our newly created VPC “MyVPC”
Note:  There will be a default Internet Gateway, DO NOT detach/delete it.

In order to make the instances created in Public subnet internet accessible, we will create a new “Route table”, that will establish connection between Public subnet and Internet Gateway.

Note: It is not recommended to modify “main” route table that was created by default when “MyVPC” was lanched.

Create a new Route table with name “PublicRT”

Select “PublicRT”, click on “Routes” tab and “edit”, Add “0.0.0.0/0” as “Destination” and click on next box, it should list the “Internet Gateway” that we created before, select it and click on “Save”.

Associate this “PublicRT” with Public subnet “PublicNet”, Select  “PublicNet” and click “Save”.

A new public vpc subnet is created.
