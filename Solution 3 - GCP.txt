Steps to Create a bucket and transfer our files to that bucket:

1) Install Cloud SDK and Python 2.7
2) open the terminal, use "gsutil mb -l asia-south1 gs://new-bucket/"
3) This creates a new bucket called "new-bucket".
4) Select the file you want to add to the new bucket and copy its address on the local computer
5) on the console use command, "gsutil cp /local-address-of-the-file/ gs://new-bucket/"
6) This copies the locally stored file onto the GCP bucket we created a while back
