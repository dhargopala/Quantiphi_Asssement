Creating EC2 Instance:


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/, Choose Launch Instance.

 Step 1: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), find an Amazon Linux AMI at the top of the list and choose Select.

 Step 2: Choose an Instance Type, choose Next: Configure Instance Details.

 Step 3: Configure Instance Details, provide the following information:

    For Network, choose the entry for the same VPC that you noted when you created your EFS file system in Step 1: Create Your Amazon EFS File System.

    For Subnet, choose a default subnet in any Availability Zone.

    For File systems, make sure that the EFS file system that you created in Step 1: Create Your Amazon EFS File System is selected. The path shown next to the file system ID is the mount	point that the EC2 instance will use, which you can change. Choose Add to user data to mount the file system when the EC2 is launched.

    Under Advanced Details, confirm that the user data is present in User data.

 Step 4: Add Storage.

 Step 5: Add Tags.

Name your instance and choose Next: Configure Security Group.

 Step 6: Configure Security Group, set Assign a security group to Select an existing security group. Choose the default security group to make sure that it can access your EFS file system.

You can't access your EC2 instance by Secure Shell (SSH) using this security group. SSH access isn't required for this exercise. To add access by SSH later, you can edit the default security and add a rule to allow SSH. Or you can create a new security group that allows SSH. You can use the following settings to add SSH access:

    Type: SSH

    Protocol: TCP

    Port Range: 22

    Source: Anywhere 0.0.0.0/0

Choose Review and Launch.

Choose Launch.

Select the check box for the key pair that you created, and then choose Launch Instances.
